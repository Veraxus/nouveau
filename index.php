/**
 * This file is required by WordPress.
 *
 * If you remove it, you will not be able to activate your theme because WordPress includes a hard-coded check for
 * index.php in the theme root. If this file is not present, WordPress will assume the theme is broken and will refuse
 * to activate it. There is no workaround for this.
 *
 * That said, this file is not actually used by NOUVEAU. All NOUVEAU templates can be found in the template directory,
 * which is configured via hook so that WordPress will always look for it's templates in that directory first.
 *
 * See templates/index.php instead.
