// GLOBAL SITE FRONTEND STYLING
//
// This file loads minimal Foundation components as well as NOUVEAUs own partials. You should place your own styles into
// one or more separate .scss files and import your own styles at the bottom of this file.
//
// If you just want EVERYTHING in Foundation, comment out or remove all the foundation includes and replace them with:
//
//    @include foundation-everything($prototype: true);
//
// Be warned, this will generate some HUGE css files... so think about it.
//
// Also note that our Gulp configuration includes a Sass glob tool. The * syntax we use here is not standard Sass. ;-)
