===================================
READ ME!!!
===================================
Like index.php, this is a required file for all WordPress themes, so you can't just delete it. But who wants to write
raw CSS in 2018? Instead, you can find the theme's SCSS in assets/src/scss - then use gulp to transpile those into the
assets/dist/css directory.

As for this file... just leave it alone. ;-)
